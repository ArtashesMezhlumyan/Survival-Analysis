# Survival-Analysis
This repository features code for marketing analytics, employing survival analysis and customer lifetime value (CLV) modeling on telco data. It analyzes customer churn and calculates CLV for actionable marketing insights using various parametric survival models such as Weibull, LogNormal, LogLogistic, Generalized Gamma, and Exponential. The 'telco.csv' dataset is utilized, encompassing customer attributes. The main script, Marketing_HMW3_Artashes_Mezhlumyan, covers data preprocessing, survival analysis, CLV calculation, insights, recommendations, and budget calculations. Noteworthy findings include the impact of the 'retire' variable on CLV, suggesting targeted marketing strategies for specific demographics. The analysis emphasizes tailored marketing approaches based on CLV scores and survival analysis results.
